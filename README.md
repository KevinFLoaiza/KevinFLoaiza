### ðŸ’¬ About Me:

My name is Kevin Loaiza, I am the first generation in my family line to be able to go to university. I come from a long line of farmers and it has been a great blessing in order to be able to get an education. I am originally from Las Vegas, Nevada and moved to Colorado about 18 years ago, but I still go back to visit family. Regardless, I have come to love Colorado and it's way more comfortable to be outside!
I hope to be able to present to you a visual colorful presentation of my digital portfolio so that you get a better understanding of who I am. Along with it will be a list of projects that I am proud of and enjoyed working on over the years while attending the university. Paired with my project will be programs that I have used and I am comfortable utilizing. There will also be a pdf of my resume and links to my social media platforms that give a better perspective of who I am in a public space.

### ðŸ’¡ Interest

I used to volunteer a lot at my middle school and elementary school. I was a teacher's assistant and I found it pleasant teaching others. I mainly worked with students who were in the process of learning English and would grade their work or help translate writings. I still keep in contact with some of the teachers and it has been fulfilling even going back and seeing familiar faces.

In order to get out of the house and be able to enjoy nature I dearly enjoy the outdoors that Colorado provides. Since my move to this state I have done many activities with my family. All the way from mountain biking, hiking, swimming, camping, fishing, and boat rowing.
